description: An introduction to MaintainableCSS, an approach to writing modular, scalable and of course maintainable CSS.
---

MaintainableCSS is an approach to architecting and writing modular, scalable and maintainable CSS. Not only does this guide tell you *how* to do this, but more importantly it tells you *why*.

## There's nothing to download

MaintainableCSS is not something you can download. It's a set of principles, guides and conventions to help you write CSS for small or large-scale websites.

## What does maintainable mean?

Maintainable CSS is CSS that you can edit without worrying that you've accidentally caused problems elsewhere.

## What does scalable mean?

Scalable CSS means that as CSS increases in size, it's still easy to maintain. If you've ever inherited a large CSS codebase, and been worried about making changes, you'll sympathise with me on this.

## What does modular mean?

A module is a distinct, independent unit that can be combined with other modules to form a more complex structure. In a living room, you can consider the TV, the sofa and the wall art to be modules, all coming together to create a room.

If you take one of the units away, the rest still works just fine. I don't need the TV to be able to sit on the sofa etc. In a website, you can consider these things to be be modules: header, product list, article.

## Is this for you?

If you've ever experienced pain when writing or maintaining CSS, then you will find useful information in this book. And if you work in a team, this book can save you documenting your approach to share with other team mates.

## Is this hard to learn?

No. This book can be read in less than 20 minutes which includes the rationale behind the approach. Implementing it takes less than a minute.
