description: An introduction to MaintainableCSS, an approach to writing modular, scalable and of course maintainable CSS.
---

*MaintainableCSS* is an approach to architecting and writing CSS that helps you and your team write modular, scalable and maintainable code.

This guide will help you write CSS:

- without having to override styles and,
- without causing unexpected regression.

## There's nothing to download

*MaintainableCSS* is not something you can download. It's a set of principles, guides and conventions to help you write CSS for small and large scale websites.

## What does maintainable mean?

Maintainable code means that you can edit a module and its styles without worrying that you have accidentally caused problems elsewhere.

## What does scalable mean?

Scalable code means that as the size of the CSS increases, the code is still easy to maintain. If you have ever inherited a large CSS codebase, and been worried about making changes, you'll sympathise with me on this.

## What does modular mean?

A module is a distinct, independent unit, that can be combined with other modules to form a more complex structure. In a living room, you can consider the TV, the sofa and the wall art to be modules, all coming together to create a room.

If you take one of the units away, the rest still works just fine. I don't need the TV to be able to sit on the sofa etc. In a website, you can consider these things to be be modules: header, product list, article.

## Is this for you?

If you've ever experienced pain when writing or maintaining CSS, this book can help you avoid common problems. Whether you're in a team of one or 100, you will find useful advice in this book. Even more so if your site is constantly evolving.

## Is this hard to learn?

No. This book not only tells you how to do it. But it also gives you the *why*. All of which can be read in less than 20 minutes.
