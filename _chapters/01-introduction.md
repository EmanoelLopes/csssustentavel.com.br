description: An introduction to MaintainableCSS, an approach to writing modular, scalable and of course maintainable CSS.
---

*MaintainableCSS* is an approach to architecting and writing CSS that helps you and your team write modular, scalable and maintainable code.

This means that you want to create new (or edit existing) features, without having to concern yourself with overriding styles you don't want applied. Or worse that the code you write causes regression elsewhere.

## There is nothing to download

*MaintainableCSS* is not something you can download. It's a set of principles, guides and conventions that help you write CSS for large or small scale websites.

## What does maintainable mean?

Maintainable code means that you can edit a module and its styles without worrying that you have negatively caused problems elsewhere by accident.

## What does scalable mean?

Scalable code means that as the size of the CSS increases, maintaining code isn't any harder. If you have ever inherited a large CSS codebase, and been worried about editing existing styles, you can sympathise with this.

## What does modular mean?

A module is a distinct, independent unit, that can be combined with other modules to form a more complex structure. In a living room, you can consider the TV, the sofa and the wall art to be modules, all coming together to create a room.

If you take one of the units away, the rest still works just fine. I don't need the TV to be able to sit on the sofa etc. In a website, you can consider these things to be be modules: header, product list, article.

## Is this for you?

If you've ever experienced pain when writing or maintaining CSS, this book can help you avoid common problems. Whether you're in a team of one or 100, you will find useful advice in this book. Even more so if your site is constantly evolving.

## Is this hard to learn?

No. The entire book can be read in under 20 minutes which gives you the rationale. And when you're convinced you can apply the rules instantly. Let me know if you have trouble and I will help you.
