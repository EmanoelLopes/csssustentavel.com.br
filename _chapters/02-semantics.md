description: Why naming something based on what it is, instead of how it looks or behaves is a cornerstone of writing well architected and maintainable CSS code.

Summary: Name something based on what it *is*, not how it *looks* or *behaves*.

## The longer explanation

Semantic HTML isn't just about the elements we use. It's quite obvious that we should use `<a>` for links, `<table>` for tabular data and `<p>` for paragraphs etc.

What's not quite so obvious is the values we give to class names (and IDs). These attributes allow us to enhance a web page with style (and behaviour) using CSS (and Javascript).

<br>&mdash; <cite>Phil Karlton</cite>

It's important to get naming right. Humans are not so good at understanding abbreviated, non-semantic abstractions.

## Good and bad class names

Can you spot the difference between semantic and non-semantic class names?

	<!-- bad -->
	<div class="red pull-left">
	<div class="grid row">
	<div class="col-xs-4">

These classes don't tell you *what* this HTML represents. At best, you may have an *idea* of what these elements look like (at certain screen sizes), but that's all.

	<!-- good -->
	<div class="header">
	<div class="basket">
	<div class="product">
	<div class="searchResults">

On the other hand, the intention of this HTML is clear. I don't have a clue what these things look like but that's okay. That's what CSS is for. Semantic class names mean something to HTML, CSS, Javascript and automation test scripts.

There are many reasons why semantic class names are advantageous:

## 1. Because it's easier to understand

Whether you're looking at HTML or CSS, you know what you're affecting. With visual class names you end up having to sprinkle several class names on to each element, ending up with a vague understanding of the intention of these visual class names. This is hard to maintain.

## 2. Because it's easier to build responsive sites

Styles often change based on viewport size. For example, you might float elements on big screens but not on small screens. If you have, for example, a class called `clearfix` but it doesn't clear on small screens, your code is misleading.

If you use semantic class names, then you can style them differently based on media queries making it easier to maintain.

## 3. Because they're easier to find

If an element has classes based on how it looks such as `.red` and `.pull-left`, then they will be scattered all over the codebase. If youâ€™re trying to hunt for a particular piece of HTML, the class name won't help you.

On the other hand, if your class names are semantic, a search will find the HTML in question. Or if you're inspecting an element then finding the related CSS selectors based on the class name will be far easier.

## 4. Because you don't want regression

When you edit a class that describes *style*, the change will propogate to every single element with that class. Knowing CSS as you do, do you feel comfortable that you didn't cause unexpected problems elsewhere?

Semantic class names are unique, so when editing one, you'll feel confident that your change only applies to the module in question, making maintenance easier.

## 5. Because you don't want to be afraid to update code

When you don't feel confident modifying code, you either cause problems or you avoid it. The latter means that you'll end up with redundancy which causes maintenance issues.

## 6. Because it's easier to write automated tests

Automated functional tests work by searching for and interacting with elements. This may include:

* clicking a link;
* finding a text box;
* typing in text;
* submitting a form; and
* then verifying something.

Visual class names don't allow you to target specific elements because they're applied to multiple elements. What I've seen people do in this case is apply an extra semantic class name just for the tests to work.

## 7. Because they also provide hooks for Javascript enhancements

Just like the previous point, these hooks are useful for Javascript. Visual class names can't be used as a reliable way to target elements.

## 8. Because they need less maintenance

If you name something based on what it is, you won't have to update the HTML again. A heading is always a heading, no matter what it *looks* like. The styling might change but this only requires a CSS update. This is known as Loose Coupling which improves maintainability.

## 9. Because they're easier to debug

If you use visual class names, when inspecting an element there will be several applicable CSS selectors. This means you have to wade through many more lines of code. With semantic class names there will be just one.

## 10. Because the standards recommend it

On using the class attribute, HTML5 specs say in 3.2.5.7:

> "[...] authors are encouraged to use values that describe the nature of the content, rather than values that describe the desired presentation of the content."

## 11. Because you get a small performance increase

This is a *very* small benefit but when you have one class name per element, you end up with smaller HTML. And whilst the CSS might get a little bigger, it's cacheable.

## 12. Because it adheres to the reuse rule

If you don't use semantic class names, then you will likely be breaking the rules of reuse. Read the next chapter to find out more.

<!--## Why? Because visual class names might declare the same property!

It's likely that several different utility classes could refer to the same property meaning order matters and performance degrades.

Think of an example of this.

## Final thoughts about semantics

Semantic class names are a corner stone of *MaintainableCSS*. Without this, everything else makes little sense. So name something based on what it is and everything else follows.
